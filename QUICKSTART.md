## First Use (1 minute)

### Step 1: Browse Normally
Just use your browser like normal. The extension automatically captures pages in the background.

**What gets captured:**
- Screenshot of the page
- Page title and URL
- Dominant color
- Whether it has images, videos, or code
- Sample of the text content

**What DOESN'T get captured:**
- Incognito tabs (by default)
- Non-http(s) pages (like chrome:// pages) or (like brave:// pages)
- Anything you exclude in settings

### Step 2: Wait a Bit
Give it a few minutes to capture some pages. Browse 5-10 websites to see it in action.

### Step 3: Search!
1. Click the extension icon (purple in your toolbar)
2. Try searching for something you just visited
3. Or use filters like "Today" or the color picker
4. Click any result to reopen that page

## Pro Tips 💡

### Finding Pages
- **Text search**: Type keywords from the title or page content
- **Color search**: Click the color picker to find "that blue website"
- **Time filters**: Use "Today" or "This Week" buttons
- **Content filters**: Find pages with images, videos, or code

### Best Practices
1. **Let it run for a day** - The more history you build, the more useful it becomes
2. **Exclude sensitive sites** - Go to Settings → Add banking/private domains
3. **Adjust retention** - Settings → Change how long to keep history (default: 30 days)

## Privacy Settings

Click "Settings & Privacy" in the extension popup to:

### Must-Do Privacy Steps
1. **Exclude sensitive domains**
   - Add banking sites (e.g., chase.com, bankofamerica.com)
   - Add work email (if you want)
   - Add any private sites

2. **Check incognito setting**
   - Enabled by default (incognito tabs NOT captured)
   - Keep it this way for privacy

3. **Set retention period**
   - Free version: up to 30 days
   - Adjust based on your needs

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I know it's working?**
A: After browsing a few sites, click the extension icon. You should see thumbnails of recent pages.

**Q: It's not capturing a page!**
A: Some reasons this happens:
- Page didn't fully load
- It's an incognito tab
- It's a chrome://, brave://, or extension page
- Domain is in your exclusion list

**Q: How much space does it use?**
A: About 100KB per page. So 100 pages ≈ 10MB. Check Settings → Storage to see your usage.

**Q: Can I pause it?**
A: Yes! Settings → Toggle "Enable Capture" off. Toggle back on to resume.

**Q: How do I delete everything?**
A: Settings → Delete All Data. **This cannot be undone.**
